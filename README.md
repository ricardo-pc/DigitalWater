# Digital Water

Our solution, **Digital Water**, was created and presented for the Atos IT Challenge 2020, an international competition themed **Cooperative Artificial Intelligence**. Participants were challenged to "devise an innovative use case and build a prototype demonstrating Cooperative AI, including plans for further development and market potential." After eight months of dedicated work, my team and I earned **second place** among thousands of competitors worldwide, becoming the **first Mexican team** to achieve this distinction in the competition's 10-year history.

## About the Project

This project explores the application of machine learning to improve water resource management. Its goal is to forecast water demand, which refers to the amount a city needs within a given period, alongside the available water capacity from its sources. While this analysis represents a mass balance and does not account for losses from the source to the final point, we recognize these losses as a significant factor.

Being a native of Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, M√©xico, I focused this project on my home state, using real data provided by the official utility, **Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey**. At the time, we were unaware that Monterrey was on the brink of a severe water crisis, which began just two years after the project‚Äôs completion. Our model hinted at this possibility, but we either did not believe it or did not want to.

The water crisis in Monterrey was devastating. Only after experiencing the constant anxiety of opening a faucet, unsure if water would flow, do you truly value something that always seemed guaranteed. Ironically, in one of Latin America‚Äôs wealthiest cities, where gleaming skyscrapers and high per capita income symbolize progress, all five million residents were reduced to just a few liters of water daily for nearly two years.

## Usage

Follow these steps to explore and use the project:

---
### **1. Clone the Repository**
I encourage to use Google Colab instead of running locally, since the project uses tensorflow. If you do want to run locally, start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardo-pc/DigitalWater
cd DigitalWater
```

### **2. Set Up the Environment**
Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **3. Run Locally**

### **4. (Preferred Method) Running on Google Colab**
You can use the provided Google Colab notebooks for cloud-based execution:
- Open the links below:
  - [LSTM Model for Water Demand Forecasting (Daily Frequency)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13yPnbwGNcaFmu-ZtK3e1szrSs9KpPFuU/view?usp=sharing)
  - [LSTM Model for Water Dam Capacity Forecasting (Daily Frequency)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1603DqfzgQ1hrN4icgQF8LZZEbKpwE5Gm/view?usp=sharing)
- Duplicate the notebook.
- Connect to a Colab runtime.
- Execute the cells sequentially.


## Data

This project relies on datasets stored in the `data/` directory. Below are the details and instructions for using the data:

---

### **1. Included Datasets**
The following datasets are included in the repository:
- **`daily-water-demand-wrangled-data.csv`**: Ready-to-use wrangled data for the water demand model.  
  - alternatively you can wrangle your own dataset using the raw data.
- **`water-dam-C-capacity-data.csv`**: Ready-to-use wrangled data fro the water dam capacity model.
- **`dictionary.pdf`**: Data dictionary explaining each field.

---

### **2. Data Sources**
If additional data is required, you can obtain it from the following sources:
- [CONAGUA](https://sih.conagua.gob.mx): Water Dam Capacity data.


---

### **3. Data Format**
Ensure your custom datasets meet the following format requirements:
