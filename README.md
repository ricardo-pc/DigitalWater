# Digital Water

Our solution, **Digital Water**, was created and presented for the Atos IT Challenge 2020, an international competition themed **Cooperative Artificial Intelligence**. Participants were challenged to "devise an innovative use case and build a prototype demonstrating Cooperative AI, including plans for further development and market potential." After eight months of dedicated work, my team and I earned **second place** among thousands of competitors worldwide, becoming the **first Mexican team** to achieve this distinction in the competition's 10-year history.
